# BonzOS Licensing Theory

I'm making this in free time just for my own edification. I do not expect
this to ever be commercially viable, or even useful to other people.
Therefore, I really don't care what you do with this, as long as nobody
thinks I warrant this software to be free of defect (I don't). Have fun,
and if it blows up, it's not my problem.

# BonzOS Warranty

This program is free software. It comes without any warranty, to the
extent permitted by applicable law. 

# LGPL Components

`bochs_vga.h` uses names and numerical parameters from the Bochs
project; however, in accordance with section 5 of the LGPL 2.1 that the
original file is licensed under, I believe the above license applies.
In particular, I only use numerical paramters from the Bochs project and
do not require linking with Bochs.

The relevant portion of the LGPL:

>   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
> Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
> linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
> work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
> therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
> 
>   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
> creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
> contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
> library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
> Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

>   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
> that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
> derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
> Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
> linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
> threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
> 
>   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
> structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
> functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
> file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
> work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
> Library will still fall under Section 6.)
> 
>   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
> distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
> Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
> whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
